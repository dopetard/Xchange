# Xchange

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dopetard/xchange.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dopetard/xchange)

XChange, an open-source white-label exchange solution for everyone with built-in liquidity. The goal of XChange is to make it possible for technically capably individuals, as well as tech entrepreneurs to operate a digital asset exchange and offer this service to friends & family or as a business to the open public. XChangeâ€™s technology is developed by the XChange team and comes with the liquidity and trading pairs within [XUD](https://github.com/ExchangeUnion/xud/). XChange is an important step in the gradual transition towards decentralisation of the asset exchange ecosystem and will enable the launch of thousands of new digital asset exchanges all over the world.
