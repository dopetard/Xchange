## Error handling

If a request fails the only value returned to the client will be a string with the key `error`. This string contains information about the reason why the request failed and may be shown to user. The easiest way to check if a request failed is reading the HTTP status code of the response. If the status code is not `200` it is very likely that the request failed.
