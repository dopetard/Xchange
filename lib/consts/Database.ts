 * The following definitions are in sets of triplets, one for each Model (which represents a table in the database).

 * "xFactory" is the type definition for the object which is required when a new record is to be created.
 *
 * "xAttributes" is the type definition of the record. It cannot support nullables, as it is being used for the table's columns definition.
 *
 * "xInstance" is the type definition of a fetched record as a Sequelize row instance, which contains some util properties.
